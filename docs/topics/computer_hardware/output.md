# Output

Output hardware translates the information that has been processed by the computer to the user in a form that the user can understand. The most common device is the **monitor**.

## Types
There are 4 types of output:
- Text (Eg. Characters in a Word document or printed on paper)
- Graphics (Eg. Images displayed on the screen)
- Audio (Eg. songs and other sounds that are heard from speakers)
- Video (Eg. Movies displayed on the monitor)

## Categories of Output

### Hard Copy Output
- Hard copy is a relatively permanent form of output that can be read immediately or stored for later use such as paper.

### Soft Copy Output
- Soft copy is a temporary form of output (Eg. Text on a screen display)
- It is lost when the computer is turned off unless it is saved in the main memory or on a disk.


## Hard Copy Output Devices

    .rightside {
        float: right;
        margin: 0 0 1em 1em;
        max-width: 30%;
        max-height: 10em
    }
</style>

### Printer (most common form)

#### Impact Printers
Impact printers produce output by striking a ribbon with a hammer. When the ribbon is hit a mark is made on the paper behind it.

#### Non-Impact Printers:
Non-impact printers do not produce output by striking a ribbon with a hammer. They are quieter than impact printers. Each type of non-impact printer produces output in a different way.

### Plotter

<img class="rightside" src="media/examples/plotter.webp" title="HP Plotter"></img>

- Output devices especially used for architectural and engineering drawings.
- Uses pens to produce large line-drawings, such as blueprints.

## Types of Impact Printers

### Dot Matrix Printer

<img class="rightside" src="media/examples/dot_matrix.jpg" title="Dot Matrix Printer"></img>

- This printer forms images one character at a time as the **print head** moves across the paper.

- The **print head** is a component in the printer that enables it to print. It usually has 9 or 24 pins.

- This type of printer is **slow**, **noisy** and produces **low quality output**.

- Dot Matrix printers are **cheap** and have **low operating cost**.

It prints up to 450 characters per second.

### Daisy Wheel Printer

- When a letter is to be printed the wheel rotates so that the correct letter is lined up with the ribbon. The wheel is then pressed against the ribbon to print the character on the page. 

- The daisy wheel printer use a **wheel** as a print head.

- The character pattern are arranged around the edge of the wheel.

- They print at **very low speeds** but produces **high quality print**.

### Line Printer

- Unlike the dot matrix and daisy wheel prniter, the line printer prints a **whole line of text** at a time.

- They are normally used when high volumes of output are required.

- Line printers are **very fast** but also expensive.

This printer cannot produce graphics

## Non-Impact Printers

### Laser Printer

- A laser image is used to draw the image to be printed onto a light sensitive **drum**. **Toner** (powder ink) is then put onto the drawn image and it sticks to it. The toner is then transferred to the paper as it passes over the drum.

- The laser printer is fast, quiet and produce high quality output.

- The laser printer prints a whole page at a time.

### Ink-Jet Printer

- This type of printer produces output by squirting tiny jets of ink at the paper to be printed on.
- A column of ink jets in the head moves across the page squirting dots onto the paper to make the image.
- The ink jet printer produces output of lesser quality than laser printer.
- The ink jet printer is are slower than the laser printer but faster than impact printers.
- Ink cartridges for ink jet printers can be expensive.

### Thermal Printer

- This type of printer creates print images on special heat sensitive paper using heated wires in the print head.
- The image is produced from small black dots that are made on the paper by heating it up.
- The heat sensite paper used is expensive.

## Soft Copy Output Devices

### Monitor

Monitor, also referred to as Visual Display Units (VDUs), is an output device that displays that the user is doing on its screen. There are two popular types. **Cathode Ray Tube** (CRT) and **Liquid Crystal Display** (LCD).

Most computers use a monitor as their main output device.

### Cathode Ray Tube Monitor
- A CRT monitor is a computer display set with a large, deep casing. 
- This type of monitor uses streams of electrons that activate dots or pixels on the screen to create a full image.

### Liquid Crystal Monitor

- A LCD monitor is a thin computer monitor that displayes images through the use of a liquid crystal display.
- LCD screens are found in most laptop computers as well as in flat panel monitors, and have replaced traditional CRT monitors for many users.

### Projector

This is an output device that takes images from the computer and project them onto a large screen for viewing. It is normally used when displaying something to a large audience.

### Speakers

Speakers are output devices that are connected to a computer's sound card and outputs sound generated by the computer.
