# Work-Related Disorders

If our devices are positioned incorrectly or we use them imporperly, we are likely to develop work-related disorders.

These are conditions caused by the work environment or the way in which we work.

Some work-related disorders include:
- **Repetitive Strain Injury** (RSI)
- **Tendonitis** and **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**
- **Computer Vision Syndrome** (CVS)
- **Lower Back Pain**

## Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI)

RSI is a broad term that encompasses several disorders. It is caused by **forceful, awkward and/or repetitive use of the limbs** which result in damaged muscles, tendons or nerves

### Causes of RSI
- Repitition
  - Long hours of keying or using the mouse in a similiar motion or pattern.
- Improper posture
  - Long hours of improper posture while keying or using the mouse
- Lack of rest
  - Extended use of the keyboard or mouse without breaks

### How to prevent RSIs

- Take frequent breaks during any long computer session to stretch your hands and arms.
  
- Place a wrist rest between the keyboard and the edge of your desk so that the wrist can be in a neautral position, not pressing on anything while typing.
  
- When using the mouse, lightly grasp the mouse and lift your finger up and down rather than your wrist.
  
- Position your mouse as the same height as your keyboard.
  
- Move your entire arm around and not just your wrist

### Tendonitis

This is the most common RSI. It is the inflammation of a tendon which occurs when a person overuses or injures a tendon (a tissue that connects muscle to bone). It can occur in the elbow, wrist or fingers.

#### Symptoms
- Pain that extends form the forarm to the hand
- Tingling in the fingers
- Swelling around the wrist joint

### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Repeated use of the wrist and fingers cause compression of the nerve that connects the forearm to the palm of the hand.

#### Symptoms
- Burning pain when nerve is compressed
- Numbness and tingling in the thumb and first two fingers.
  
## Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)

CVS is strain on the eyes that happens when you use a computer or digital device for prolonged periods of time.

### Causes
- Poor room lighting
- Glare on a digital screen
- Improper viewing distance from the screen (too close/too far)
- Seating posture
- The angle of your head
- Existing vision problems you may have

### Symptoms
- Eye strain
- Headaches
- Blurred or double vision
- Sore, tired, burning, itchy or dry eyes
- Neck or shoulder pain
- Increased sensitivity to light
- Difficulty shifting focus between monitor and document

### How to prevent CVS
- Rest eyes when using the computer for long periods of time. A 15 minute break after 2 hours of continuous computer use is recommended. Also for every 20 minutes of computer use look into the distance for 20 seconds to allow  the eyes to refocus (20-20-20 rule).
- Always find a comfortable distance between your eyes and screen; ensure the screen is at or slightly below (4-5 inches) eye level.
- Reduce glare and reflections from your computer scren i.e. clean your screen and block excessive sunlight and reflections.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen so that there is a high contrast between text on the screen and screen background.
- Make sure the lighting in the room is comfortable on the eyes and prevents you from staring into glare on the computer screen
- Position the digital display so that your head is in a naturally comfortable position while using.
- Try to blink frequently to minimize developing dry eye. Blinking keeps the front surface of the eye moist.
- Make sure your seat is comfortable. A comfortable chair with support for your neck and back will help you avoid neck and shoulder strain commonly associated with computer vision syndrome.

## Lower Back Pain

Large amounts of preassure to the back muscles and spinal discs is referred to as lower back pain. These pains occur because sitting, in an office chair or in general, is a static posture that increases stress in the back, shoulders, arms, and legs. Lower back pain is caused by:
- Bad posture
- Sitting for long hours
- Poorly designed or incorrectly assembled furniture or equipment.

### Symptoms
- Pain in lower back
- An inability to stand up straight without pain
- Pain that can radiate down to the leg to the foot

### How to prevent lower back pain
- Use a firm, adjustable and comfortable chair. The back of the chair should support your lower back, feet flat on the floor, thighs about parallel to the ground with the knees slightly higher than the seat of the chair. 
- Periodically stretch your lower back by standing up and pulling each knee to your chest and hold that position for a few seconds.
- Relax your shoulders. When youâ€™re typing, your upper arm and forearm should form a right angle, with your wrist and hand in roughly a straight line.
- Take short breaks. Leave your desk and walk around for about five minutes every hour.
