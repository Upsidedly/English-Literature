# Best Practices

## Desk

- Your desk should have enough room beneat it for your legs to fit comfortably and with your feet flat on the floor. You should also be able to cross your legs.
- Your arm should be able to rest on the desk at an angle between **90** and **110** degrees.
- Adjustable height desks or sit to stand desks are ergonomic solutions to desk usage in the workplace

## Monitor

- Your monitor should be placed at least **20** inches or arm's length away from you.
- The top line of your screen should be at or below eye level.
- Your monitor should be tilted at an angle between **10** and **20** degrees.
- The room and monitor should be adequately lit. The screen should be glare and reflection free.
  
## Keyboard and Mouse

- Your keyboard should be infront of you at a distance you can comfortably reach with your elbows at your side. It should also be centered i.e the letter B should be in front of your navel
- Your keyboard and mouse should be at a height which allow your forearms to be parallel to the ground and your wrists straight, not bent.
- Your mouse should be contoured so that it reduces unconscious gripping or tension in your fingers.
