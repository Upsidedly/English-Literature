# PC Assembly

> [!WARNING]
> The order of assembly is important. 

## 1 - Before

Clear work area of food debris and accessories. Disconnect all network cables and power supply. Use the correct tools throughout the assembly process.

Avoid electrostatic discharge for static electricity can cause significant damage to your computer components. To prevent this from happening:
- Wear an **antistatic wrist band** or **antistatic mat**
- Keep sensitive components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
- Hold computer components by their edges only.
- Avoid assembling computers in areas of high static such as carpeted areas.
- Regularly areound yourself by **touching something made of metal** as you assemble.

## 2 - Prepare Motherboard

The **motherboard** connects all of your hardware to the processor, distributes electricity from the power supply and has ports that alow the processor to connect to input, output and storage devices. To prepare the motherboard you must install the **CPU**, **heat sink**, **and RAM**

### Installing the CPU (1/3)

- Inspect pins for damage
- Open the socket
- Locate the arrow on both the chip and socket and align them
- Insert processor and make sure there is no gap between the bottom of the chip and the socket
- Close socket

### Installing the heat sink (2/3)

A heat sink is designed to move heat away from the CPU to prevent overheating.

To install the heat sink:
- Apply thermal tape or thermal paste on top the processor (an adhesive to form a bond form a bond and fill up the gaps between the CPU and heat sink)
- Align the heat sink squarely above the processor and press gently to secure it
- Plug the power connector for the cooling unit into the motherboard

### Installing RAM (3/3)

- Consult the motherboard manual to ensure you put the RAM chips into the correct slots.
- Unhinge/open the clip on the RAM slots
- Align the Ram chips with their corresponding slot and gently press it down until the clips are back into place.

## 3 - Mount the Motherboard to the Case

- Install the input/output (I/O) shield at the back of the PC case in the designated slot.
- Insert spacers into the holes on the PC case and install the standoffs into the holes on the motherboard.
- Place the motherboard inside the case and align the standoffs.
- Using a screw secure the motherboard to the case without screwing it too tightly. Very that the back of the motherboard is not touching the case and the slots and connectors line up properly.

## 4 - Connect the power supply

- Mount the power supply to the case of the PC and screw into place.
- Connect the two power cables
  - **ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)** cable - **20** or **24** pin cable
  - CPU power cable - **4** or **8** pin cable

## 5 - Connect front panel and USB

- Locate the following wires and connect them to the appropriate pins on the motherboard:
  - Power switch
  - Power LED
  - Hard drive (HDD) LED
  - Speaker

- Connect any front USB ports to the appropriate connectors on the motherboard.

## 6 - Install hard drive and CD-ROM

- Slide drive into selected drive cage at the front of the PC away from the other components and screw the drive into place.
- Connect one end of the **SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)** to the drive and the other end to an avaliable SATA port on the motherboard.
- Connect the drive to the power supply.
- Repeat to install the CD-ROM.

## 7 - Installing a graphics card

The video card is usually the **last component to be installed** because it takes up the most space. This is optional, since some motherboards have build-in video cards.

Line up the graphics card's main connector with the **PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)** slot to ensure that the grooves in the connector match those inside the PCI slot and push down on the card until the clip in the PCI close (or click).

## 8 - Booting of the System & POST

When the computer is turned on, the Power-On-Self-Test (POST) determines if the hardware of the computer is working correctly.

If the hardware is functioning normally, you will hear **one short beep** and the computer will boot. However, if there is a fault within the system, there will be a series of beeps to indicate faulty hardware.

If the system passes the POST, then the operating is loaded into RAM. This process is known as **booting**.
