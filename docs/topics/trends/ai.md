# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial:
- Human-like but not human
- Computer programs
- Machines

Intelligence:
- Reasoning
- Adapt to environment
- Solve problems

Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is a popular branch of computer science that concerns building "intelligent" smart machines that can apply the intelligence of the human brain. It deals with the simulation of intelligent behaviour in machines and computer systems and the ability of a machine to copy intelligent human behaviour.

## Categories

There are 2 A.I. categories

#### Narrow A.I
- Refers to A.I. that performs a narrowly defined and structured task
- Human behavior is programmed based on a set of rules and context
- Eg: facial recognition, internet search

#### General A.I
- Refers to A.I that can have the same capability as humans to understand and navigate various scenarios
- Still in development stages - A close example is Hanson Robotics robot, Sophia.

## A.I. Interactions in Daily Life

- Virtual Assistants
- Smart cars
- Social media feeds and recommendations
- Chat bots
- Predictive text
- Face ID
- Video games
- Smart email
