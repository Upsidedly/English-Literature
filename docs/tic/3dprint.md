# 3D Printing

3D printing is the process of creating a physical, tangible, 3-dimensional object from a digital model or file which is 3D in nature. 

It is also known as additive manufacturing because the printed objects are created by adding layers of printing materials on top of eachother. 

> Additive manufacturing uses less material than subtractive manufacturing

### 3D Printed Items

- Industrial products like manufacturing tools
- Dental products like dentures
- Prosthetics
- Architectural models
- Props for movies
- Consumer products like eyewear, clothes, furniture, footwear
- Biomaterials like the human kidney
- Food

### 3D Printing Process

**Step 1**
Create a digital 3D model using Computer Aided Design (CAD) or other design software (or choose from a 3D model library).

**Step 2**
Use slicing software to slice the design into individual layers for printing. You must also choose your desired material.

**Step 3**
Send the file to the printer to print.

**Step 4**
Sand or paint the 3D object for your desired outcome.
